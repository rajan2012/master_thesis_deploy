##introduction 
mostly from expose docx 

##hypothesis 
what you have assuemed , pre info which is going to give u result 
like disease is pattern ,sometimes like symptoms tells u story and why this body got this symptoms 
--Writing a hypothesis for a thesis involves clearly stating what you intend to prove or explore through 
your research. It should be a concise, testable statement that predicts an outcome based on the variables you're studying
Identify the independent and dependent variables in your study. The independent variable is what you manipulate, and
the dependent variable is what you measure.
symptoms will tell u disease ,its like symptoms is model running on human body and human feels the result and effect 

hypothesis for insurance -If regular exercise is increased, then the levels of cardiovascular health will improve."
People who exercise frequently (more than 5 hours per week) will have lower stress levels compared to those who exercise occasionally or rarely





###materials 
kaggle ,hugging face 
python 
streamlit ,lot of library of python
googlecollab 
mock up data from chatgpt and internet 
manually manipulating data of symptoms like making symptoms more organized and 
like pain in leg,arm into pain in leg arm -pain_leg_arm 




##methods 
for dis symp 
preprocessing -merging data , 
all basic method of preprocessing ,initial to final datasets which i start working to which is used to make model  
symot , all words combined with _ 
smote ,pca
ensemble with voting 


for drug 
modify , 
wordmap 
barchart 
visulization 


for insurance 
numerical to categorical 
algorithm 
label encoder 
prediciton 


###result and discussion 
streamlit 
user input 
visulization 
table 
model for all 4 use case 
model iteration and final choice of model 
all the figures of evaluation 



##conclusion 
##future work
